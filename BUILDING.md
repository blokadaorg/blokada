# Installing

Make sure you have flutter installed. Recommended way:

> brew install --cask flutter

Do once:

> flutter pub get

You should be able to run the project on simulators after this (mocked). Use Android Studio.

To run the full apps (with this lib), go to the appropriate app repo on our Github and see the building instructions there.
