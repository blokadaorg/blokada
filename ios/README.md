# Blokada 6 for iOS

Blokada 6 is the newest edition of the well known open source mobile ad blocker and privacy app. It requires a subscription to run.

Want to try it out? **[Click here to open Apple App Store](https://go.blokada.org/appstore)**.

## Difference to Blokada 5

There is also Blokada 5 with on-device adblocking (as opposed to cloud adblocking of Blokada 6). It does not require subscription, and is entirely free to run. Blokada 5 is currently available only on Android.

Both editions are being developed independently. See our main Github page for the source code.
