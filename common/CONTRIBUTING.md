# Contributing to Blokada

Work in progress...

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Blokada! :sparkles:

We are pleased to open up the project to you - our community. How can you contribute?

## Share feedback
Contact us at https://go.blokada.org/feedback if you have feedback, questions or want to chat.

## Report an issue
A great way to contribute to the project is to report an issue when you encounter a problem.

We want our app to be as stable as possible thus your bug reports are immensely valuable. When reporting bugs let us know the:
* App version
* Device model
* OS version
* Steps to reproduce the bug
* Expected behavior
* Actual behavior


## Contribute Code
We welcome pull requests aimed at fixing bugs and security issues. If you have a great idea you really want to implement, start by logging an issue for us and mention that you are interested in helping. If it fits with our product direction and is a good candidate for community development we may be able to bend the rules and work with you to develop it.

## Style Guide

We care about clean code. Refer to our style guide (TODO).
