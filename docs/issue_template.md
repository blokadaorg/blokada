Thanks for reporting issues back to Blokada! Please follow few simple rules:

- **Before** you go ahead and record the bug you found, we would like to ask you to take a look on our [Knowledgebase site](https://support.blokada.org). Maybe it is already solved and the solution is provided there.
- Use search here, on GitHub, to validate if your issue isn't already reported
- Read answers to common questions at http://go.blokada.org/faq
- Having a problem with a particular app? Maybe we know already, check http://go.blokada.org/issue_app
- Blokada not working at all? Maybe your device has known issues, check http://go.blokada.org/issue_device
- Reporting a bug? Your title must answer a question "What does not work for you?" (example: "Blokada randomly closes after few days", but not, "It doesn't work"). Also make sure you follow the rest of the template and provide complete information.
- Requesting a feature? Take a look around [here](https://github.com/blokadaorg/blokada/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atype-F) if that isn't yet requested. Your title must be a full sentence starting with "I want" (example: "I want a widget for turning filtering on/off", but not, "Tasker support"). You can skip the rest of the template.

### Actual behaviour
What happens, what malfunction do you see? Please describe as detailed and good as possible, it helps us to narrow down the scope and start debugging.


### Expected behaviour
What would you expect to happen instead of the one you see?


### Steps to reproduce  
Let us know how can we get the same result that you have. If it happened only once, please check if you can get the same misbehaviour again. Don't report one-time-only glitches.
