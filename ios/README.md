# Blokada 6 for iOS

Blokada 6 is the newest edition of the well known open source mobile ad blocker and privacy app. It requires a subscription to run.

Want to try it out? **[Click here to open Apple App Store](https://go.blokada.org/appstore)**.

## Difference to Blokada 5

There is also Blokada 5 with on-device adblocking (as opposed to cloud adblocking of Blokada 6). It does not require subscription, and is entirely free to run.

Both editions are being developed independently. See our main Github page for the source code.
