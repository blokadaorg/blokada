 * When some devices, like Huawei, get into some kind of powersave mode, they start to block network
 * access causing the tunnel's send attempts to fail. Bringing up activity raises the app out of
 * those limitations. This activity is transparent and finishes immediately, to not be visible to
 * user. I couldn't find a nicer way to do this.
